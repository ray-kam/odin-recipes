    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Super Tuber is a great snack that uses one of my favorite vegetables: The Idaho Potato. Of course, I suppose any type of potato could be used, but I cannot guarantee that a Super Tuber made with anything but a true Idaho potato would taste as good. Sincerely, Larry E. Craig. United States Senator</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 hot dog, cook's choice</li>
        <li>1 Idaho baking potato, 7 to 10 ounces</li>

        <li>Other condiments as desired such as cheese sauce, sour cream, chili, chives, bacon pieces, or black olives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
