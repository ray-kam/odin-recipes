    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Super Tuber is a great snack that uses one of my favorite vegetables: The Idaho Potato. Of course, I suppose any type of potatoe could be used, but I cannot guarantee that a Suepr Tuber made with anything but a true Idaho potatoe would taste as good. Sincerely, Larry E. Craig. United States Senator</p>
