    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You can make cold brew on the weekend, then pour your coffee from the fridge every morning. No boiling water. No
        fussing with a coffee maker.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3oz coarsely-groud coffee</li>
        <li>3 cupes water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 1-quart wide-mouth mason jar, combine the coffee and water. Stir to combine. I like to let my mixture
            rest for about 5 minutes and stir it again; the coffee grounds seem to gain more water exposure this way.
        </li>
        <li>Put a lid on your container and refrigerate it for 12 to 18 hours.</li>
        <li>When youâ€™re ready to strain your cold brew, place a thin paper coffee filter or a small, thin cotton napkin,
            cloth or handkerchief over a small fine-mesh sieve. Pour the concentrate through the prepared sieve into a
            liquid measuring cup or pitcher. Let it rest for a few minutes to let the last of the cold brew trickle
            down.</li>
        <li>To serve, fill a glass with ice and fill it halfway with water. Then fill the rest of the glass with cold
            brew concentrate, and stir to combine. Cold brew concentrate will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 2
            weeks, although I find that it has the best flavor within the first week.</li>
    </ol>
